## 1. Creating the Database

The Jupyter Notebook *database.ipynb* contains the code to query IEEE Xplore with a defined search string. To target specific journal our conferences the publication numbers can be used. Depending on the response size of your request, the query can take up to 30 Minutes or more.

## 2. Labeling the Research Articles

Once the database is complete, the functions and definitions in the *labeling.ipynb* notebook can be utilized. By adding different rules or altering the wording, the code can be adapted to any topic.

## 3. Analysis

Given the tags, one can analyze trends, distributions or anything else. In the three remaining notebooks some examples are shown.
